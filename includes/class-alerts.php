/**
 * Alerts — email notification when the sync auto-unpublishes events.
 *
 * Why: the 2-consecutive-misses auto-draft rule (Event_Ingest::prune_missing)
 * assumes "absent from the feed" means "removed at the source". The 2026-07-22
 * Feierabend incident proved Facebook's Graph API can silently drop a single
 * valid occurrence of a recurring event, hiding a live event from the site
 * with no visible trace. This class makes every auto-draft announce itself.
 *
 * One email per sync run (not per event, not per feed) — prune_missing()
 * notes each draft into a per-run collector; Feeds::run() flushes it once
 * at the end. Dry runs never note, so previews can't send mail.
 *
 * @package GASF_Events
